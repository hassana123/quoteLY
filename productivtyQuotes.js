    "Work hard, have fun, and make history.",
    "Don’t worry about breaks every 20 minutes ruining your focus on a task. Contrary to what I might have guessed, taking regular breaks from mental tasks actually improves your creativity and productivity. Skipping breaks, on the other hand, leads to stress and fatigue.",

    "Improved productivity means less human sweat, not more.",
    "It’s not always that we need to do more but rather that we need to focus on less.",
